# PlayOnLinux - Hatfall: Hatters Gonna Hat

A script for PlayOnLinux to install Hatfall on.

# Usage
Download hattersgonnahat.pol. Afterwards in PlayOnLinux go to Tools/Run a local script. Direct the software to the right file and agree to running the code. (Check it carefully! I didn't insert anything malicious in it, but if you got it from somewhere else I don't guarantee anything!) Follow the instructions on screen afterwards.

Installation is largely automated, requiring minimal input from the user, making it easily possible in an ELI5 tutorial.
